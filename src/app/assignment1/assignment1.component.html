        Transcript: There are so many books and so little time to read them.
        There are somewhere around 1,000,000 books published every year in the
        US alone. I am a big lover of books; they have been part of my life,
        especially novels. It is well said that books can be your best and true
        companion. One of my friends asked me why Books are so heavy; for his
        question, I replied instantly, "Because the whole world is inside them."
        Television, the Internet, and TV Shows can look appealing, but nothing
        can replace a Good Book. Reading is a Dream that you hold in your hands;
        it gives you wisdom, solution, new perspective, imagination, improves
        your confidence, improves your mental health.

        <strong>The steps to create the video</strong>
        <br />
        1. I decided to use Canva Website as my editing tool since it has a good
        UI & UX and I was working with Canva for a long time.
        <br />
        2. To create a video I used Images, Animation, Text and background music
        of the available options on Canva website. Then I putted them together,
        changed the lenght of each video and removed the noise.
        <br />
        3. For some part of the video I added a text.
        <br />
        4. I used my recorded audio which is related to the video and added it
        as background audio over the music. The audio is easy to hear.
        <br />
