        In lab5, I learned how to draw a static sketch in p5.js, but I had no
        idea how I could make them move for this assignment. I learned that the
        <strong>draw()</strong> function is automatically called after the
        <strong>setup()</strong> function, which runs once at the programâ€™s
        start. Then draw() loop infinitely runs the code block inside the
        function from top to bottom. All shapes are drawn using functions such
        as <strong>ellipse(), rect() and line()</strong>. The first thing I
        learned about making movements was using variables.
        <strong>Variables</strong> are a crucial component for creating movement
        in p5.js. To make my clouds run over time, I incremented and decremented
        the variables with each frame. I learned how to keep track of the number
        of frames rendered by using a built-in variable called
        <strong>frameCount()</strong>. This variable counts the number of frames
        that have been displayed since the program started.
