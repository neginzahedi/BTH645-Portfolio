      <strong
        >1) The reason of choosing the file format when creating your
        audio.</strong
      >

      <br />
      For the original audio, I chose WAV file format. The reason is WAV files
      can be edited. Then I made changes to the original and saved it as MP3.
      The MP# is the compressed and final version to release the file.<br />
      <br />

      <strong>2) The use of audio on your website regarding usability.</strong>
      <br />
      The reason for putting the audio on the website is that there is a short
      story on the same page. I give the user this usability on the website to
      listen to the short story instead of reading it.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >3) Any thoughts on different audio file formats, e.g., cons, pros, when
        to use.</strong
      >
      <br />
      This lab was a good practice on flearning diffrences between diffrenet
      audio file format. I learned that:
      <br />
      - .wav: to store uncompressed, Lossless, CD-quality sound files. Itâ€™s a
      lossless file format, meaning that there is no data loss whatsoever.
      <br />
      - .mp3: files to save compressed Lossy sound files. Uncompressed audio
      formats like WAV provide excellent sound quality with large file size. But
      for file-sharing on the internet, uncompressed files like MP3s were born
      to have much less size.
      <br />
      <br />

        >4) Description of your editing on the file, e.g., cutting, assembly,
        fadein, fadeout, etc.</strong
      >
      <br />
      I used Audacity software which does not have a good UI&UX for a person
      unfamiliar with recording software. I could only change the volume on some
      parts of the original audio and save it to .mp3 instead of .wav format as
      a final internet-friendly version. <br />
